Marketing Performance Analytics | KPI Tracking | Business Insights

Welcome to the Quarterly Sales Dashboard 2024 repository! 🚀
This project presents a business-focused Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales and marketing performance using industry-standard KPIs such as CTR, CPC, ROAS, and ACoS.

The dashboard is designed from a Business Analyst perspective, emphasizing performance efficiency, cost optimization, and actionable insights rather than raw numbers alone.

🔹 Data Cleaning Layer (Preparation)

Imported raw campaign-level sales and marketing data

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized column names and data types

Prepared a clean dataset for Power BI modeling

🔹 Data Analysis Layer (Modeling & KPIs)

Built base measures for Sales, Spend, Clicks, and Impressions

Created calculated KPIs using DAX:

CTR (Click Through Rate)

CPC (Cost Per Click)

ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)

ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales)

Defined benchmark targets for performance evaluation

🔹 Dashboard Layer (Visualization & Insights)

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard

Added slicers for Month and Campaign Name

Used icons and indicators for quick performance interpretation

Included a Key Insight section for business recommendations

# 📖 Project Overview

Areas for optimization and growth

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

🟦 Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard creation

📗 Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI calculations and indicators

📊 Key KPIs Tracked

💰 Total Sales

💸 Total Ad Spend

👆 Total Clicks

👁️ Total Impressions

➡️ CTR – Click Through Rate

💵 CPC – Cost Per Click

📈 ROAS – Return On Ad Spend

⚠️ ACoS – Advertising Cost of Sales

# 🎯 Target Benchmarks

Industry-standard benchmarks were used to evaluate performance:

✅ ACoS ≤ 25%

✅ ROAS ≥ 4.0

✅ CPC ≤ ₹5.00

ℹ️ CTR ≥ 0.40% (reference benchmark)

# 📊 Dashboard Insights

The final dashboard provides visibility into:

Monthly Sales vs Spend trends

Campaign-wise sales contribution

Marketing efficiency using CPC, ROAS, and ACoS

Performance indicators with visual arrows and legends

# 💡 Key Insight

📉 High ACoS and low ROAS indicate inefficient ad spend.
Despite a healthy CTR, conversions are weak, leading to poor return on investment.

# 🛠️ Recommendation

Optimize or pause low-performing campaigns

Reallocate budget toward high-ROAS campaigns

Improve conversion efficiency through better targeting and landing page optimization
